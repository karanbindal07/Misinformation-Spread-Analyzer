Description:
This project uses the FakeNewsNet PolitiFact subset distributed as two CSV files:
- politifact_real.csv
- politifact_fake.csv

Each row corresponds to a fact-checked news item from PolitiFact, labeled as real or fake.
This dataset provides article-level content/metadata fields but
does not contain the same Twitter conversation-graph diffusion fields used in Stage 1.

Files used:
- data_fakenewsnet/raw/politifact/politifact_real.csv
- data_fakenewsnet/raw/politifact/politifact_fake.csv

Notes:
Raw CSVs are stored locally and ignored by git. Only processed outputs and documentation are tracked.
