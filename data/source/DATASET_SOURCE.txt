Description:
Graph-based Twitter dataset where each graph represents a conversation
related to COVID-19 topics. Each conversation is stored as a graph
with tweets as nodes and interactions as edges.

Processing:
The original dataset is distributed as multiple graph folders
containing nodes.csv files. A master tabular dataset
(covid_misinfo_raw.csv) was constructed by aggregating all nodes.csv
files and assigning labels based on graph folder categories
(misinformation vs non-conspiracy).

Notes:
This dataset is used for educational and research purposes.
